# SeaSS

Welcome to Belize's project: SeaSS.

Keen to practise my CSS skills and highlight Belize's coastline diversity, SeaSS takes the user on a journey through the cayes' corals thanks to animal animations!

Simply scroll along on mobile or desktop and enjoy the creatures that come your way!

Hosted independently [here](https://belize.cat-miller.com/).

A full write up, with further information about the project, can be found on [What's My Country Code - Belize](https://whatsmycountrycode.cat-miller.com/belize).
